# Advent of Code 2022

This year I'm trying AoC in Tust to kick the tires a litte.  But I may backfill some of them in Lean4.  Caveat lector - I know neither language.

I went through day 3 in rust, then backported / redid each in lean4.


## Lean

Day3 - I had one function that it wouldn't accept as total. And bit operations are kinda painful. I probably should define some operators to make it prettier.


Day 5 - I did this in rust initially. Lots of weird issues dealing with borrow checker. Also I accidently did part2 first.
