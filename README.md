# Advent of Code 2022

This year I'm trying AoC in Tust to kick the tires a litte.  But I may backfill some of them in Lean4.  Caveat lector - I know neither language.

I went through day 3 in rust, then backported / redid each in lean4.


Day3 - I had one function that it wouldn't accept as total. And bit operations are kinda painful. I probably should define some operators to make it prettier.


Day 5 - I did this in rust initially. Lots of weird issues dealing with borrow checker. Also I accidently did part2 first.

**Day 8**

- List is not a monad in Lean.
- Implicits don't work like Idris - `{f : Forest}` was not found.
- I had to take a different approach for part 2, thought about going back and refining part1.

- In the Rust version, I got to learn about writing iterators with a directional tree iterator.
- Went back and reworked lean version to work similar to Rust version.

**Day 9**

- Went fairly quickly.  Still need to go back and do the Rust version. (Too busy with other things.)

**Day 10**

- I ended up just injecting instructions rather than dealing with the two cycle instructions.

**Day 11**

All the decisions appeared to be modular, so I went with `lcm` of every discriminator for part 2. Threaded through a function to refine the value rather than turn the state into a structure, because I was feeling lazy.

In some of these puzzles, I've been on the fence whether to use a State monad, or just thread through the value and `foldl`. For both Lean and Rust, I really should handle checking of indices at compile time, but it'd take more time to figure that out.  I feel like I'm cheating when I do `[x]!` in lean...

In Rust I had to implement `gcd` and `lcm`. I had issues with not being able to pass in a closure, like a did for lean (for part1 vs part2 value reduction). And finally I had an issue where mutability screwed me up. I resent the monkey count for part2, but forgot that there was other state in there that needed to be reset. I did realize that trimming will make my sketchy parser look better, so I went back and tweaked the lean code to do the same.

**Day 12**

At some point I'd like to get a better feel for how the index checking works in lean. (See below, I figured out some of it via Zulip search.)

**Day 13**

This went smoothly. I used Lean's parsec for this one.  We'll see what I do on the rust side when I get to it.

**Day 14**

Day 14 went fairly smoothly. I ended up just using a hashmap for the grid so I wouldn't have to figure out sizing.  It was fast enough.

**Day 15**

I got this working well enough, but I'd like to come up with a strategy to skip rows, so part 2 doesn't take 30s.


## Rust Notes

- Editor tooling is nice:
    - Auto insert of imports
    - Good descriptions of what to do when I do something stupid
    - The run thing is nice, but Lean kinda has me spoiled on that front.
    - Add missing match cases
- Minus on editor tooling:
    - Showing the types is really annoying, makes the formatting of code look awful,
      I think I'd prefer on hover.
- I keep forgeting snake_case
- Writing > instead of >> can lead to some hard to follow syntax errors.
- When I create a new project (cargo init), it doesn't seem to be picked up in an existin vscode window without reloading.

## Lean Notes

- Hard to find functions (e.g. how do I turn a List Char -> String, took a while to figure out)
- The List is not a monad thing threw me off a little.
- Not sure where the docs are for libraries, I've been searching the source.
- I really like the results panel in vscode tooling, it updates as I type code. 
  (Even better than jupyter)
- I don't get my magic Idris `[]` and `::`.
- Lean produces executables, but they're like 50 MB for a tiny program (day8) vs 572k

I had a question on this:
```lean
  for r in [0:data.size] do
    -- lean doesn't figure out that r : Fin data.size
    match data[r]!.getIdx? needle with
    ...
```

It turns out that you can pull in a proof that `r âˆˆ [0:data.size]` with a colon:
```lean
for h : r in [0:data.size] do
  have : r < data.size := h.2
  match data[r]!.getIdx? needle with
  ...
```
(It suffices to just bring h.2 into scope by assigning it to a name.)

```lean
  -- I'd like to use Idris | notation here, is there an equiv?
  let start := (grid.find? 83).get!
```

I managed to figure out day13 that the notation is there, but it doesn't have a match in the `|` branch, so my blind attempt to use it didn't work.
